# Easydiff

These are two versions of an extremely dumb reverse-mode autodifferentiation library I created for a tutorial. The first, `easydiff.py`, supports only first derivatives. The second, `deepdiff.py`, should support arbitrarily many. Definitely not production- or even research-ready, but the code ended up being pleasantly clear and terse, so I'm putting it up here.
